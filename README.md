# Data-science-practicum
### Course Overview and Learning Outcomes 
The course is aimed at providing graduate students with an understanding of and experience with turning 
statistical theory, methods, and computing from prior courses into real practice through data science practicums 
inspired by realistic projects. The course will largely focus on the three core skills/aims outlined below.  
(1) Framing real-world data problems into testable and solvable statistical problems.  
(2) Developing analysis/solutions that are fast, scalable, and robust.  
(3) Communicating solutions concisely and clearly, creating understandable and accurate visual/tabular   
summaries of the data analysis, and responding to audience questions clearly.  
The course plans to develop these skills with the modules described below. Aim (3) will be strongly emphasized 
across all modules. We expect students to demonstrate the three core skills at the end of the course.
